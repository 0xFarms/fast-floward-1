# Fast Floward | Week 1 | Day 5

Welcome to Day 5, the last day of Fast Floward Week 1! What an incredible spurt we've made over this past week. Starting with simple, interpreted Cadence statements, all the way up to a client implementation of the Artist app that prints actual Non-Fungible Tokens for users. But this is just the start of your journey! Today, we'll add a new feature to the Artist app â€“ trading. In the process, we'll learn about how to combine functionality of two smart contracts, and a new Cadence concept called `interface`. Let's make Day 5 the best yet!

A quick review of Day 4 before we get going.

# Day 4 Review

  - Use the `fcl.send` method to interact with the blockchain by sending scripts and transactions.
  - Use `fcl.authz` as a shorthand for current user.
  - FCL automatically converts Cadence types and values into JavaScript equivalents with `fcl.decode`.
- Flow Testnet provides an easy way to test DApp integrations with live user wallets.
  - To view contracts deployed to testnet, use [flow-view-source.com][1].
